### Dependencies Analysis

- **No unused dependencies found**: All dependencies are actively used
  - CMake: Required for build system
  - Protocol Buffers: Required for .proto file compilation
  - nanopb: Required for embedded C protobuf implementation
  - GCC: Required for C++ compilation
  - Python: Required for build tools in `tools/` directory

### Test Results

All functionality verified working:
- Message publishing and subscription
- Copy operations
- Multi-subscriber scenarios
- Protocol buffer message generation
- C++ compilation and linking

### Notes

- Updates were performed using official releases and pre-built binaries where possible
- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- No breaking changes to the MREQ API
- Project continues to work as a header-only C++ library for embedded systems
